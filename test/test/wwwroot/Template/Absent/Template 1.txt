Hi,

I’m on vacation until [vacation end date] and unavailable to respond until I return.

[Contact person’s name] is covering for me this week, so you can reach out to them at [contact person’s phone number] or [contact person’s email address] if you need help immediately.

I’ll be back in the office on [return date], so you can reach me then. Thanks, and I’ll talk to you soon!

Best,

[Your name]
